# New Plugin

This is a bare-bones React project. It contains a simple React view with the libraries for using the [CODAP Plugin API](https://github.com/concord-consortium/codap/wiki/CODAP-Data-Interactive-Plugin-API).

# Copying from the starter project

## Create a new repository

There are two ways to create a new repository from this template:

### Method 1: Using GitHub Template Button
1. Go to this repository's GitHub page
2. Click the green "Use this template" button at the top
3. Select "Create a new repository"
4. Set your repository name (e.g. `new-repository`)
5. Choose visibility (public/private)
6. Click "Create repository from template"
7. Clone your new repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/new-repository.git
   cd new-repository
   ```

### Method 2: Using Command Line
1. Create a new public repository for your project (e.g. `new-repository`)
2. Create a clone of the starter repo
    ```
    git clone --single-branch https://github.com/concord-consortium/new-repository.git new-repository
    cd new-repository
    ```
3. Next, re-initialize the repo to create a new history
    ```
    rm -rf .git
    git init
    ```
4. Add a remote to your GitHub repository
    ```
    git remote add origin https://github.com/concord-consortium/new-repository.git
    ```

## Initialize new repository

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Optionally Run: `npm update` to update the dependencies. If you can, it is best to do this in the `new-repository` first before making your new repository.
3. Run `npm start` to start the `webpack-dev-server` in development mode with hot module replacement
4. Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (or use port 8081 if you are already using 8080). You should see a basic plugin with a heading of "New Plugin".

   It's ok if you see an error like `handleResponse: CODAP request timed out: [{"action":"update","resource":"interactiveFrame","values":{"name":"Sample Plugin","version":"0.0.1","dimensions":{"width":380,"height":680}}},{"action":"get","resource":"interactiveFrame"}]`. This just means that the plugin is running outside of Codap, so is not receiving responses to API requests, which is expected.
5. Run `npm test` to verify that the test suite still passes.
6. Run `npx playwright install` to install the playwright browsers
7. Run `npm run test:playwright` to verify the playwright tests still pass. The Playwright tests verify that the plugin works correctly inside CODAP.
8. Search and replace instances of `new-repository` with `new-repository`.
9. Search and replace instances of `New Plugin` and `New Plugin` with `New Plugin`.
10. Update the general description of the project in the first section above.
11. [Setup AWS keys for S3 Deployment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VqEwnHcmv5EnGq4fQI7l6zur_rV4F-BdKYEy4LdDjY4/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0). This is so the GitHub actions can deploy to S3 and save the Playwright results.
12. Configure the Codecov token.
    1. Find the new repository at https://app.codecov.io/gh/concord-consortium
    2. Choose the repository token option
    3. Add the token to the GitHub repository as described on the codecov page.
13. Remove this `Copying from the starter project` section of the `README`, but keep track of the next step.
14. Create an initial commit for your new project and push it.
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git push -u origin master
    ```

Your new repository is ready!

# Development

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository and `cd` into the new folder.
2. Install the dependencies `npm install`.
3. Run the development server `npm start`.
4. Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (or use port 8081 if you are already using 8080). You should see a basic plugin with a heading of "New Plugin".

   It's ok if you see an error like `handleResponse: CODAP request timed out: [{"action":"update","resource":"interactiveFrame","values":{"name":"Sample Plugin","version":"0.0.1","dimensions":{"width":380,"height":680}}},{"action":"get","resource":"interactiveFrame"}]`. This just means that the plugin is running outside of Codap, so is not receiving responses to API requests, which is expected.

## Testing

### Jest Tests
The project uses Jest for unit testing. To run the tests:
```
npm test
```

### Playwright Tests
The project uses Playwright for end-to-end testing. These tests verify that the plugin works correctly inside CODAP. Playwright has lots of features including a VSCode plugin. Below are some basic steps to get started.

Before running tests for the first time you need to install the Playwright browsers:
```
npx playwright install
```

After this you can run the tests without showing a browser or run them with a visible browser.

#### Run without a visible browser
```
npm run test:playwright
```
If you want to view a test report of these tests you can run:
```
npx playwright show-report
```
#### Run showing the browser
```
npm run test:playwright:open
```

### Testing in CODAP

There are two ways to test the plugin in CODAP:
- running it locally on https and use the deployed CODAP
- running it and CODAP locally on http

#### HTTPS
1. Start the plugin with `npm run start:secure`. You need to first setup a local http certificate if you haven't done so: https://github.com/concord-consortium/codap/blob/main/v3/README.md#run-using-https
2. Run CODAP v2 or v3 with the `di` parameter:
    - v2: https://codap.concord.org/app/?di=https://localhost:8080/
    - v3: https://codap3.concord.org/?di=https://localhost:8080/

#### HTTP
1. Start plugin webserver `npm start` (it will be on 8080 by default)
2. Setup a local webserver running CODAP.
    - v2: Download the latest `build_[...].zip` file https://codap.concord.org/releases/zips/. Extract the zip to a folder and run it with a local webserver. For example `npx httpserver -p 8081`
    - v3: Checkout the v3 source, install the dependencies, and start the dev server: https://github.com/concord-consortium/codap/blob/main/v3/README.md#initial-steps. The dev server should automatically choose the next avaiable port which would normally be 8081
3. Open CODAP with the plugin embedded in it: http://localhost:8081/static/dg/en/cert/index.html?di=http://localhost:8080
